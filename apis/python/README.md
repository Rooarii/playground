# Django / Django Rest Framework (drf) 


## Set Up

- Create a virtual environment:

    ```shell
    $ python<latest_version> -m venv .venv
    ```

    > **_NOTE:_** In this case i'll use python 3.10

- Activate the virtual environment

    ```shell
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

  To check that your virtual environment has been activated:

    ```shell
    $ which pip
    working_directory/.venv/bin/pip
    ```

- Install required libraries/dependencies:

    ```shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
  You might have to upgrade your pip version:

  ```shell
      pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
